                The Nashville Predators (commonly referred to as the Preds) are a professional ice hockey team based in Nashville, Tennessee. 
                The Predators compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference, and 
                have played their home games at Bridgestone Arena since 1998. Their television broadcasting rights are held by Bally Sports 
                South, and the Nashville Predators Radio Network flagship station is WPRT-FM. The Predators are currently affiliated with two 
                minor league teams: the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), and the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL. (Wikipedia 2024)

                    The club was founded in 1997, when the NHL granted an expansion franchise to Craig Leipold, with the team beginning play in
                    the 1998–99 season. After five seasons, the Predators qualified for their first Stanley Cup playoffs during the 2003–04 season. 
                    In 2008, ownership of the team was transferred from Leipold to a locally based ownership group. The Predators advanced to their 
                    first Stanley Cup Finals in 2017, but were defeated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. In the following season, the 
                    Predators won their first Presidents' Trophy and Central Division title. (Wikipedia 2024)
